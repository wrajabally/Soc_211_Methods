    "    My model should be clustered because each case in my data is divided up into different pumas in California.  So therefore applying robust standard errors in each puma may provide a more equal variance of standard errors.  When I ran it, the clustered standard error actually increased from .0000594 to .0001281.  The clustering may have increased the standard error because the rate of in-migration (measured by moving in) varies depending on which puma, and is not equally distributed. However the standard error is still very low.  Based on this I believe that the cluster robust model is the best to use because we achieve a low standard error and still are able to take into account the effect of the pumas."
